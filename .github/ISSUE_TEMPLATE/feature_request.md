## Userstory
Please formulate what someone should be able to do and break it down into the smallest possible pieces.

e.g.:
- A `user` of PiCure needs to receive e-mail updates.
- A `user` of PiCure needs to be able to set a custom schedule based on which e-mails will be send. At least it should be possible to send a summarized update once every XY minutes/hours/days/weeks.

Possible users are:
- `users`. They are described as regular people running a curing cabinet on PiCure. They do not develop they simply install & update
- `powerusers`. They can configure PiCure and understand the system well enough to perform basic troubleshooting. They can alter the existing code-base to e.g. work with specific hardware
- `developers`. They extend PiCure and fix issues


## Usecase
Please describe how and when and why someone would need this feature
